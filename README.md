**Tonight I'll ask you to:**

- Share your thoughts on difficult topics
- Be kind and thoughtful when responding to the ideas of others
- Form groups to discuss and work together on design challenges
- Find a well-positioned seat at your group's table or stand and move around the table
- Help to document the night by taking photos of your work and tweeting it with the `#openseattle2017` hashtag.

## 1. Concept mapping

#### On post-it notes:

- issues that are faced by local residents
- everything you can think of related to civic technology, government technology, community engagement, and local civic issues
- people, places, and things

> Take a picture and tweet it with #openseattle2017

#### On a big sheet of paper:

- organize the notes you've created so far into related groups
- circle and label related notes
- draw lines between related circles and label them

## 3. Stakeholder mapping

#### On post-it notes:

- Draw symbols representing types of people and organizations who are stakeholders in local civic issues
- Write a speech bubble for each one summarizing their mindset / goal
- Write a label below each symbol with their role, explaining who they are

#### On a big sheet of paper:

## 4. Prioritizing stakeholders

#### On a big sheet of paper:

- Create three large headers, dividing the sheet in three: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary
  - like this:

| Primary             | Secondary           | Tertiary          |
| :------------------ | :------------------ | :---------------- |
| Stakeholder 1       | Stakeholder 2       | Stakeholder 3     |

- Prioritize the stakeholders by who may be most negatively impacted by changes that occur over the next 4 years because of the presidential election outcome. Stakeholders most negatively affected in the Primary section.
- If you realize you're missing stakeholders, add post-it notes for them! Please also put a checkmark in the upper right corner.

## 3. Projects

#### On post-it notes:
- Similar to the first exercise of the night, write down every project you can think of related to civic tech, gov tech, civic engagement, etc.
- Consider the concepts and stakeholders from previous exercises in your project ideas.
- The goal is a lot of them! Not a couple perfect ones.

#### On a big sheet of paper:

- Create a matrix with importance on the x-axis, and difficulty on the y-axis. Like this but better:

|                     |                     |                   |
| :------------------ | :------------------ | :---------------- |
| **More difficult**  | topics              | topics            |
| **Less difficult**  | topics              | topics            |
|                     | **Less important**  | **More important** |

- Place each project post-it note on the matrix based on its importance and difficulty.
- When considering importance, think about the results of the last exercise where we prioritized stakeholders. Consider projects that help address issues faced by stakeholders in the "Primary" column as higher in importance.

## 4. Prototype

Based on the results of the last exercise, choose one project that resonates with your group.

#### On a big sheet of paper:

- Create a sketch of a feature story about your project in a news publication
- The story is this: your project was successful! The story briefly describes how stakeholders came together to make the project happen.
- Include:
  - at least one image (don't worry about it being well-drawn)
  - a few paragraphs telling the story
